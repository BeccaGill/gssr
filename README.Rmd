A package wrapping the General Social Survey 1972-2019 cumulative data file for use in R. 

<img src="man/figures/fefam_svy.png" width = "95%"/>

## Installation

You can install the beta version of gssr from [GitHub](https://github.com/kjhealy/gssr) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("kjhealy/gssr")
```

## Loading the data

The GSS cumulative data file is rather large, and so it is not loaded by default when you invoke the package. (That is, we don't use R's "lazy loading" facility.) To load the data, do the following:

```{r load}
library(gssr)
data(gss_all)
```

```{r peek}

gss_all

```

To load the tibble that contains information on the variables in the data, do this:

```{r load-doc}
data(gss_doc)

gss_doc
```

You can take a look at information on a particular variable by doing something like this:

```{r varlook}

gss_doc %>% filter(id == "race") %>% 
  select(id, description, text)

```

To look at a variable's marginals or its properties, use `unnest()`:

```{r marginals}

gss_doc %>% filter(id == "race") %>%
  select(marginals) %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(marginals))

```


```{r properties}

gss_doc %>% filter(id == "race") %>%
    select(properties) %>%
    unnest(cols = c(properties))

```

## Further details

The package is documented at <http://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/>. The GSS homepage is at <http://gss.norc.org/>. While the `gssr` package incorporates the publicly-available GSS cumulative data file, the package is not associated with or endorsed by the National Opinion Research Center or the General Social Survey.

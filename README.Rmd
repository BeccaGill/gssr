# gssr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An package wrapping the General Social Survey 1972-2019 cumulative data file for use in R.

## Installation

You can install the beta version of gssr from [GitHub](https://github.com/kjhealy/gssr) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("kjhealy/gssr")
```

## Loading the data

The GSS cumulative data file is rather large, and so it is not loaded by default when you invoke the package. (That is, we don't use R's "lazy loading" facilty.) To load the data, do the following:

```{r load}
library(gssr)
data(gss_all)
```

```{r peek}

gss_all

```

To load the tibble that contains information on the variables in the data, do this:

```{r load-doc}
data(gss_doc)

gss_doc
```
